import Counter from "./test/Counter";

Ever struggle with setInterval in React?

React is notoriously known for "intriguing problem"'s when trying to implement setInterval. The why and possibly the best solution
to that is using Dan's declarative `useInterval` hook described in his [blog](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)

| In action

<Counter client:load />

First we show complete solution using the `useInterval` in React followed by a solution using `rxjs` observables in Xania.

## Table of contents

## React

```typescript
/** React */

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(1000);

  useInterval(() => {
    // Your custom logic here
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, delay);

  return (
    <h1>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <input value={delay} onChange={e => setDelay(e.target.value)} />
    </h1>
  );
}

function useInterval(callback, delay) {
  const savedCallback = useRef();

  // Remember the latest function.
  useEffect(() => {
    savedCallback.current = callback;
  }, [callback]);

  // Set up the interval.
  useEffect(() => {
    function tick() {
      savedCallback.current();
    }
    if (delay !== null) {
      let id = setInterval(tick, delay);
      return () => clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, [delay]);
}
```

If you just care about a working solution in React you can stop reading.

But me, I care about my long experience with rxjs and want to leverage that to develop my UI, and you should care too.

Let see how we can fix this with rxjs.

## Alternative solution with rxjs

```typescript
/** @xania/view */

function Counter() {
  const delay = new Rx.BehaviorSubject<number>(1000);
  const count = delay.pipe(
    Ro.switchMap(d => Rx.timer(0, d)),
    Ro.scan(acc => acc + 1, 0)
  );
  return (
    <h1>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <input value={delay} change={e => delay.next(e.node.value)} />
    </h1>
  );
}
```

Yes, this is all! is this easy? no, not if you stuggle with rxjs.

The point here is that if you do know rxjs then you can just throw that at Xania and it all works.
If there are other reactive libraries that you rather use then
Xania supports it too in case it support the following observable pattern

## Minimal api of Observable pattern

```javascript
/** Observable pattern support in @xania/view */

interface Observable<T> {
  subscribe(observer: NextObserver<T>): Unsubscribable;
}

interface NextObserver<T> {
  next(value: T): void;
}
```
